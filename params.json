Have you ever been about to “Punch Out” with a vast amount of food in your arms and not known how much your purchases will come to? Have you ever wondered how many punches it takes to buy a case of Gatorade? Do you have a phone or tablet that runs Android?\r\n\r\nIf you replied, “YES! OH MY GOSH YES!” to any of the aforementioned questions, then we have the Application for you!\r\n\r\nThe application has a beautiful icon that was custom designed by the design team.  A simple white circle stands out against a dark background of the default Android wallpaper. A small Sexton silhouette graces the screen with its polygonal presence. Clicking on the self-titled Application designed by member of Team Superion brings you to a flashy splash page that advances to a home page with two options on it. A famished user can either choose to view the food selection by pressing, “Browse Food Selection,” or “Meal Punch” if the user knows for sure that he/she wants to use a Meal Punch. These are especially useful if installed on an Android device and the user is not at Sexton and wants to peruse the meal and food options. One of the advantages to A glorious picture of the Sexton Building also manifests itself across the Meal Options Page.\r\n\r\nLet’s say that the user has selected the Meal Punch Option but doesn’t know what to get? Here’s where the random button can come into play. There are a number of different meal options that can be selected with and without sides. Selecting the random button will pick a random meal for you! Hot chocolate, Fish Burger and Fresh Fruit! You probably never thought of choosing that options, but now you will never forget the combination sensation that it created in your mouth. The Punch Page also counts the number of Total Calories in each particular meal in case you are watching your college figure.\r\n\r\nIn case you want to buy a bulk number of items, say, 35 Mountain Dews and 20 Cinnamon Rolls, (Finals Week?) this can easily be accomplished without even connecting to the Internet. The database that we are pulling from is stored locally and can be updated by Team Superion in the future if store menus change. A total price counter on the bottom of the screen allows the user to see the vast amounts of currency that is automatically updated as the user selects items from the food list. \r\n\r\nA checkout page is adorned with multiple reset buttons for intense customization of each incrementing element on the page. A scrolling shopping cart at the top of the checkout page allows the user to see their selections. If it is towards the end of the semester and a user only has 1 punch and a select amount of flex left, a user can easily see which combinations of payment are best without wasting precious money on food.
